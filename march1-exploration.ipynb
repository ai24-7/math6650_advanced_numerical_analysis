    "### Summary\n",
    "The paper begins with a discussion around challenges of topology optimization in multiphysics problem (problems with dual objective functions). The authors describe the concept and methods of topology optimization in engineering and the application of machine learning models in this field. Then, the authors demonstrate their method by describing shutter constraints and metrics, optimization flow and neural network architecture. Their proposed approach balances computational efficiency with accuracy and offers potential for broader applications in engineering design. Next, they further discuss the challenges to make a suitable dataset and explain the structure of PerfNN and TopOptNN models. Finally, they show the result of their experiment in a variety of figures and conclude the advantages and limitations of their method."

    "#### Topology optimization\n",
    "In order to maximize system performance, topology optimization is a mathematical technique that optimizes material layout inside a particular design space for a given combination of loads, boundary conditions, and restrictions. In contrast to shape and sizing optimization, topology optimization allows the design to take on any shape inside the design space; it does not deal with preset configurations. The design performance is assessed using the finite element method (FEM) in the traditional topology optimization formulation. Either gradient-based mathematical programming approaches, such the optimality criteria algorithm and the moving asymptote method, or non-gradient-based algorithms, like genetic algorithms, are used to optimize the design.\n",
