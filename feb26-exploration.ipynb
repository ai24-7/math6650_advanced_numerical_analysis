    "This paper focuses on constructing operators for approximating high-dimensional curves based on geometric Hermite data that consists of point samples and their associated unit tangent vectors. The authors extend classical Hermite interpolation and introduce the new concept of Hermite average. Then they further discuss properties of Bezier average that is derived from Hermite average. The paper demonstrates the convergence of a subdivision scheme that interpolates geometric Hermite data, showing that the scheme's limit approximates the sampled curve. In the next section, the authors provide various numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of their approach. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential future work in this field. In appendix, the authors provide proofs of some of the properties mentioned in the paper like Bezier average. "
